# BlueBank
This project is a website I'm currently designing for banking using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It will allow users to create an account and login using passport JS. 
So far I have completed making the front-end design of the home page. 
I incorporated bootstrap and some JavaScript to enhance the design and user interaction. 
The next steps in this project are to create some more pages, and connect them all together in the back-end development stage.
